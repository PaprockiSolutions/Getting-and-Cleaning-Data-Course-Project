# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository includes the following files:

-   `run_analysis.R`: An R script designed to process the dataset.
-   `tidy_data.txt`: The resulting tidy dataset.
-   `CodeBook.md`: A document detailing the variables and the transformations applied.
-   `README.md`: This document.

## Instructions

1.  Download the dataset from [this link](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) and extract it in your working directory.
2.  Ensure that `run_analysis.R` is in the same directory as the extracted dataset.
3.  Execute `source("run_analysis.R")` to create the tidy dataset named `tidy_data.txt`.
